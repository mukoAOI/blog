**第三部分：基本句型**

一、英语句子的基本结构可以归纳成五种基本句型及其扩大、组合、省略或倒装。掌握这五种基本句型，是掌握各种英语句子结构的基础。

**二、英语五种基本句型列式如下：**

基本句型一： Ｓ +Ｖ （主＋谓）

基本句型二： Ｓ +link-Ｖ +Ｐ （主＋系＋表）

基本句型三： Ｓ +Ｖ +Ｏ （主＋谓＋宾）

基本句型四： Ｓ +Ｖ +IO +Ｏ （主＋谓＋间宾＋直宾）

基本句型五： Ｓ +Ｖ +Ｏ +Ｃ （主＋谓＋宾＋宾补）

**三、基本句型一：Ｓ +Ｖ（主＋谓）**

此句型的句子有一个共同特点，即句子的谓语动词都能表达完整的意思。这类动词叫做不及物动词，后面可以跟副词、介词短语、状语从句等。例如：

1.Time flies. 2. The moon rose. 3. The man cooked. 4. We all eat, and drink.

5. Everybody laughed. 6. I woke very soon. 7. They talked for half an hour. 8. He walked yesterday .

9.He is playing. 10.They have gone.

**四、基本句型二：Ｓ +link-Ｖ +Ｐ（主＋系＋表）**

此句型句子谓语动词不能独立表达完整的意思，必须加上一个表明主语身份或状态的表语构成复合谓语，才能表达完整的意思。这类动词叫做连系动词。系动词分两类：

(1)表示状态的连系动词。这些词有：be, look, seem, appear, smell, taste, sound, keep, remain, 等等。

(2)表示转变或结果的系动词。这些词有：become, get, grow, turn, go, come, prove等。

1. This is an English dictionary. 2. The dinner smells good. 3. He felt happy.4. Everything looks different.
2. He is tall and strong. 6. The book is interesting. 7. The weather became warmer. 8. His face turned red.

**五、基本句型三：Ｓ +Ｖ +Ｏ（主＋谓＋宾）**

此句型句子的共同特点是：谓语动词都具有实义，都是主语产生的动作，但不能表达完整的意思，必须跟有一个宾语，即动作的承受者，才能使意思完整。这类动词叫做及物动词。

1. Who knows the answer? 2. She laugh at her. 3. He understands English. 4. He made cakes.
2. They ate some apples. 6. Danny likes donuts. 7. I want to have a cup of tea. 8. He said Good morning.

**六、基本句型四：Ｓ +Ｖ +IO +Ｏ（主＋谓＋间宾＋直宾）**

此句型的句子有一个共同特点：谓语动词必须跟有两个宾语才能表达完整的意思。这两个宾语一个是动作的直接承受者，另一个是动作的间接承受者。通常这一间接承受者用一个介词来连接，当动作的间接承受者在动作的直接承受者之前时，这一介词往往被省略。

1. She passed him a new dress. 2. She cooked her husband a delicious meal.
2. He brought you a dictionary. 4. He bought her nothing.
3. I showed him my pictures. 6. I gave him a hand.
4. I told me how to run the machine. 8. He showed me that the bus was late.

**七、基本句型五：Ｓ +Ｖ +Ｏ +Ｃ（主＋谓＋宾＋宾补）**

此句型的句子的共同特点是：动词虽然是及物动词，但是只跟一个宾语还不能表达完整的意思，必须加上个补充成分来补足宾语，才能使意思完整。

1. We keep the table clean. 2. They painted the door green.
2. They call supper dinner. 4. They found the house dirty.
3. What makes him sad? 6. We saw him out.
4. He asked me to come back soon. 8. I saw them getting on the bus.

**句型六：主语+谓语+状语**

在很多情形中，作谓语的不及物动词后面跟上状语意思才完整

The pen writes smoothly. The sun rises in the east. The accident happened yesterday.

**句型七：主语+谓语+宾语+状语**

He put the coffee on the table. I Iooked at him in panic.

**句型八：there be 句型** There are many customers in the shop.

be 为谓语动词，there be 后面的名词为句子的主语，此结构中的be还可以用其他词代替，如live ,exist,stand,lie,remain,go,come等
